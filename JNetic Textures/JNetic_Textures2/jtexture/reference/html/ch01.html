			This section introduces the concepts and ideas of procedural
			textures and how they relate to the key parts of the
			framework.
		</p><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="Overview"></a>1.1.&nbsp;Overview</h2></div></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="whatisatexture"></a>1.1.1.&nbsp;What is a procedural texture?</h3></div></div></div><p>
					Put simply, a procedural texture is a procedure
					which takes input values derived from the point on
					the surface being textured, and returns a color
					value for that point on the surface. When the
					surface is considered as a whole (i.e. the
					collection of individual points), we end up with a
					textured surface.
				</p><p>
					Note that we can apply procedural textures in 2 or 3
					dimensions, but for now, we are only considering 2
					dimensions. The third dimension can often be
					represented by time creating an animated surface
					texture that changes over time.
				</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="inputParams"></a>1.1.2.&nbsp;Input Parameters</h3></div></div></div><p>
					Since we are only dealing in 2 dimensions, our
					textures will mostly consist of 2D rectangles. In
					this case, our input points consist of 2 values, one
					going across the rectangle and one going down
					forming cartesian coordinates for any point on the
					rectangle.
				</p><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="../img/surfaceExample.png" align="middle"></div><p>
					Our procedural texture takes a
					<code class="code">(u,v)</code>
					coordinate as an input parameter and returns a color
					based on the position on the surface.
				</p><p>
					The colors that we return are composed of values
					representing the red, green and blue components. We
					have an
					<code class="code">RGBAColor</code>
					class that we use to represent a color. The 'A' part
					refers to the Alpha channel which indicates how
					transparent this color is. Transparency ranges from
					0 to 1 with 0 being totally transparent and 1 being
					totally opaque. Colors can be specified using
					integers 0..255 or fractional values from 0..1. In
					both cases, the alpha is always specified as ranging
					from 0 to 1.
				</p></div></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="N10047"></a>1.2.&nbsp;Implementing Textures</h2></div></div></div><p>
				We start with a
				<code class="code">Texture</code>
				interface that encapsulates the concepts so far. Our
				interface contains methods to return a color based on
				the input values.
			</p><pre class="programlisting">
				
public interface Texture {

    RGBAColor getColor(double u, double v);
    void getColor(double u, double v, RGBAColor value);
}

			</pre><p>
				We have two methods because rather than keep creating
				<code class="code">RGBAColor</code>
				instances to return from the texture, we just pass in a
				single
				<code class="code">RGBAColor</code>
				instance that we re-use each time. If you consider a 100
				X 100 image calls the texture 10,000 times, and since we
				could be chaining textures together, we could end up
				creating tens of thousands of
				<code class="code">RGBAColor</code>
				instances. By re-using the same one and passing it
				around, we only create one and we get a 10-15% speedup.
			</p><p>
				One goal is to make the texture generation view
				independent. For example, we might display the texture
				in a small window when developing and testing it, but if
				we wanted to generate a texture for printing or saving,
				we would want to make it high resolution, and we
				probably don't want to display it. However, we do want
				to end up with the same image, but at a higher
				resolution. Therefore we decouple the view from the
				texture generation and render textures in view
				independent terms. We should be able to call our
				textures using any
				<code class="code">(u,v)</code>
				values and it should be able to calculate the color from
				that point. It is this de-coupling that lets us render
				the texture at any size, rather than define the texture
				in terms of on screen pixels.
			</p><p>
				There is an abstract class called
				<code class="code">AbstractTexture</code>
				which implements the
				<code class="code">Texture</code>
				interface and contains a number of helper functions. The
				most important one is
				<code class="code">calculateColorFromTexture</code>
				which takes the
				<code class="code">(u,v)</code>
				coordinates, a texture and checks for null textures and
				puts the texture value in the target result color.
			</p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="firstTextures"></a>1.3.&nbsp;Our First Textures</h2></div></div></div><p>
				Let's take a look at writing our first simple texture
				which is just a solid color.
			</p><pre class="programlisting">
				
public class SolidBlue extends AbstractTexture {

    public void getColor(double u, double v, RGBAColor value) {
        value.setColor(0,0,255);
    }

}
			</pre><p>
				Our simple example here just returns the same constant
				color no matter what we pass in. In order to view this
				texture, we use a class called
				<code class="code">TextureWindow</code>
				which is a Swing window that lets you render textures in
				it.
			</p><pre class="programlisting">
				
import org.texturemaker.gui.TextureViewer;
import org.texturemaker.textures.tester.SolidBlue;

public class SolidBlueDemo {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        TextureViewer.show(new SolidBlue());

    }
}
			</pre><p>
				This class can be run from the console or an IDE and
				should give you a Swing window which can be resized.
				Clicking the Start button starts the rendering process.
				Render Gradually produces really quick low res images
				which can be handy for complex textures. The anti-alias
				checkbox will use multiple samples per pixel. Neither of
				these effects can be seen in this demo because our
				texture is a single solid color.
			</p><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="../img/solidbluedemo.png" align="middle"></div><p>
				Not much really to look at here. Let's try something a
				bit fancier. Change our demo to use a different texture
				by passing a different texture to the
				<code class="code">TextureViewer</code>
				class. Let's try the
				<code class="code">
					org.texturemaker.textures.composite.ComplexMarble
				</code>
				class which is composed of a number of different
				textures to produce a nice marble effect.
			</p><pre class="programlisting">
				
public class SolidBlueDemo {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        TextureViewer.show(new ComplexMarble());

    }
}
			</pre><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="../img/marbledemo.png" align="middle"></div><p>
				This is much more interesting! It also took much longer
				to create as it is more complex. If you resize the
				window, you will notice that the pattern stays the same,
				it scales to the window size and adds more detail to
				fill the space. Now when you generate a high resolution
				texture, you know you will get the same basic image, but
				with more detail.
			</p><p>
				Here is another view of the same texture. This time, we
				expanded the window to fill the screen causing the
				texture to be rendered at a higher resolution. The
				picture below shows the top left hand corner of the
				texture. If you compare to the previous full image of
				the marble, we can see that where we have zoomed in at a
				higher resolution, our procedural texture has produced
				more artifacts and details.
			</p><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="../img/marbledemo_closeup.png" align="middle"></div><p>
				This means that if we write our textures properly, we
				can make them resolution independent. In which case, we
				can produce very high resolution versions which can be
				printed or used in other situations where we need high
				resolution detailed textures.
			</p><p>
				We use a decorator type of pattern quite often when we
				want to transform the inputs to and outputs from signals
				or textures. We can wrap another signal or texture
				around the existing one, and adjust the inputs or
				outputs to the signal or texture. For example, we might
				have a signal from 0 to 1 which is passed to a gradient
				texture. We can wrap the signal in a noisy signal so the
				output from the signal is jiggled around to produce not
				such a smooth gradient.
			</p><p>
				So now we have an easy way to test and view our
				textures, lets start looking at how we write them.
