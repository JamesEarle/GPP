Genetic Programming Portfolio

As a part of my undergraduate thesis in my final year at Brock University, I've undertaken the task of implementing a genetic programming system with the goal of forecasting stock prices. 

This is an attempt to merge both domains involved in my formal education, being Economics and Computer Science, as well as gain experience researching and contributing to the vast field of artificial intelligence.
